2-complement allows use of addition operation both as summing and subtracation funciton.

If we take the example 50-12; 2s complement does the equivalent of:

  [ 50 + {(256 - 12)] - 256}. 

  ... in an 8bit represenation

-> bit inversion and adding 1 operation accomplishes shown in bracket ()

-> the addition is simple bit addition of the result in () and 50 bound by square [] - in binary

-> subtracting 256 is equivalent to throwing the carry away
