1a-
1b) using Bit banding, the compiler produces atomic assembly instructons that are immune to alteration during interupt calls

1.c) 
LDR.N  R4, [PC, #0X34]
MOVS   RO, #1
STR    RO,[R4]

2.a) 
Multi function call is done by pushing function parameters into stack and branching to the function location; the called function will pull from the stack and use the parameters before returning. By extention; a multi-out put funciton would have pushed the output params to stack before PC returns the program flow to the calling.

2.b) STR.W [{}, {}]
2.c) PUSH  { - }

3. Code adapted from char data type queue given in the example to an int data type.
